A Python CLI project.

- UPDATELIST
- STATUS


### Learnings 
Implemented the knowledge of SQL/MySQL to develope a CLI project to mimic the MySQL internals. It was super benefitial for to in my initial days 
of learning SQL. As I had to learn a lot of MySQL internals to build the project, I also gained super handson knowledge and data manipulation on Python.  


### How To Run 

Please clone the repository, and and run `python dict_db.py`.
